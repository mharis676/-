<!-- SCRIPT FOR THE VIDEO
    
    Here's the complete script you can use for your video to explain the Age Calculator code:

### Video Script for Explaining Age Calculator Code

**[Introduction]**
"Hi everyone, in this video, I’ll be showing you how we can create a simple age calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
By the end of this video, 
you’ll know how to calculate the exact age of a person in years, months, and days based on their birthdate.

Let’s dive into the code and break it down step-by-step."

---

**[HTML Structure]**

"First, let’s look at the structure of the HTML.

At the very top, we start with the basic HTML5 template:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
```
This declares the document type and language, which is set to English.

Inside the `<head>`, we have our metadata. We set the character encoding to UTF-8 
and include the viewport meta tag to ensure our website is responsive across different screen sizes. 
The title of the page is set to 'Age Calculator.'
Additionally, we’re using a Google Font called 'Poppins' to give the page a modern, clean look. 
This is done by linking the font inside the head.

```html
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;500&display=swap' rel='stylesheet'>
```

Now, moving to the body, we have a container `<div>` that holds everything—the form and the result. 
    Let’s talk about the form. The form has three input fields:
- Day,
- Month,
- and Year.

These fields accept numeric values for the user’s birth date. 
Each field has a minimum and maximum value to ensure the data entered is valid:
```html
<input type='number' id='day' min='1' max='31' required>
<input type='number' id='month' min='1' max='12' required>
<input type='number' id='year' min='1900' max='2100' required>
```
Finally, we have a submit button to trigger the age calculation.

And below the form, we have an empty `<div>` with the id 'result'. 
This is where we will display the user’s age dynamically after the calculation."

**[CSS Styling]**

"Let’s move on to the styling part of the page.

We’ve styled the page with some basic CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive.

We set the page to use the Poppins font and added a linear gradient background to make it look fresh:
```css
background: linear-gradient(120deg, #84fab0, #8fd3f4);
```

The container, which holds the form and result, has a white background with a little transparency and rounded corners 
for a soft, modern feel. We also added a subtle shadow:
```css
box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
border-radius: 15px;
```

We included a hover effect on the container so that when the user hovers over it, it slightly enlarges to create an interactive feel:
```css
.container:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

The input fields and button are styled with padding and borders for a clean look. We’ve also added a nice border color 
change when the user clicks on an input field:
```css
input:focus {
    border-color: #4CAF50;
}
```

For the submit button, we added a hover effect that changes the background color and adds a slight scaling effect:
```css
button:hover {
    background-color: #45a049;
    transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

Lastly, we made sure the design is responsive using a media query, so on smaller screens, the font sizes and padding 
adjust to ensure everything looks good."

**[JavaScript Functionality]**

"Now, let’s look at the JavaScript code that makes this calculator work.

We start by adding an event listener to the form to handle the 'submit' event:
```javascript
document.getElementById('ageForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
```
This line of code prevents the form from refreshing the page when the submit button is clicked.

Then, we grab the values from the input fields—day, month, and year—and convert them into numbers:
```javascript
let day = parseInt(document.getElementById('day').value);
let month = parseInt(document.getElementById('month').value);
let year = parseInt(document.getElementById('year').value);
```

We create two JavaScript `Date` objects:
- `today`: This holds the current date.
- `birthDate`: This holds the user’s birthdate based on their input.

The logic for calculating the age starts by subtracting the birth year from the current year to get the age in years:
```javascript
let ageYears = today.getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear();
```

Next, we calculate the difference in months and days:
```javascript
let ageMonths = today.getMonth() - birthDate.getMonth();
let ageDays = today.getDate() - birthDate.getDate();
```

Now, here’s where things get interesting. If the number of days is negative, meaning the current day is earlier in the month 
than the birth day, we subtract one month and adjust the days by adding the number of days in the previous month:
```javascript
if (ageDays < 0) {
    ageMonths--;
    let lastMonth = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 0);
    ageDays += lastMonth.getDate();
}
```

Similarly, if the number of months is negative, meaning the current month is earlier than the birth month, we subtract one 
year and adjust the month count:
```javascript
if (ageMonths < 0) {
    ageYears--;
    ageMonths += 12;
}
```

Finally, we display the result in the 'result' `<div>`:
```javascript
document.getElementById('result').innerText = `You are ${ageYears} years, ${ageMonths} months, and ${ageDays} days old.`;
```

This displays the exact age in years, months, and days."

---

**[Conclusion]**

"And that’s it! With this code, we have a fully functioning age calculator that not only calculates your age in years 
but also breaks it down into months and days. This is a great little project to practice working with dates in JavaScript 
and a bit of dynamic styling with CSS.
